I made a few changes to the css.  I changed the color scheme to a scheme that fits my "branding"(1/3).  Using variations on aquas and greens.  I also changed font colors to fit the color scheme(2/3).  No white text on light aqua BG.  I also added some drop box-shadow to the project list thumbnails(3/3).  nothing to obtrusive.

I also changed the font to one I like much better.  (4/3)

I also added custom stuff to the error.pug.  I added back buttons (similar to the "about page").  I also added a picture anda custome message along with the not found 404 info.
